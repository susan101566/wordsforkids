ATT hackathon repo. Designing an educational android app.

The most effective way to learn a language is by practicing.

I don't know about you, but I find learning with pictures and speech way more effective than merely reading.

With this in mind, we decided to design an Android app that incorporates audio and visual cues to new phrases.

Great thanks to Janice, for staying up together in the past 24 hours.

There are two modes. In the teacher mode, a user can take a picture of any object, attach an audio with it, 
and add a description. In the student mode, the user would then click on an object and try to guess what word
should be entered. Audio is also available in case the user is stuck on guessing.

We chose to make this an offline app because we are mainly targeting children in the student mode. Parents might 
not want them to be online. We used sqlite database, camera, audio features of an android phone. 

The overall color scheme is summer-ish because we love Seattle, and summer is just starting here!

P.S. One of the main criteria that I judge if an app is useful is if I would use it. In this case, I'm a little too
old for this, but I dedicated this app to my sister, who is in the process of learning English atm. Hopefully she'll be 
able to understand this doc someday :)
